What if you could easily link a metric with a trace? And what if I told you that you can do it visually?
Meet Exemplars. They are displayed as diamonds in the graph shown below.

By the end of this blog post you will be able to set up a complete docker-compose with Grafana, Tempo, Prometheus and a simple application that produces metrics and traces and links them with exemplars.

== What are Exemplars
But what are exemplars, exactly? Exemplars are a concept from https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics/blob/main/specification/OpenMetrics.md#exemplars[OpenMetrics], implemented by Prometheus.

[quote, OpenMetrics specification]
Exemplars are references to data outside of the MetricSet. A common use case are IDs of program traces.

Grafana graphs support Prometheus exemplars. They are displayed as diamonds in the graph visualization. A mouse hovering over the diamond triggers a popup showing details about the trace along with a `Query with tempo` button which, when clicked, takes you to the corresponding trace visualization in Grafana Tempo.

== How to setup Exemplar's visualisation

=== Producing metrics and traces
The example is a candy factory run by a couple of Akka Typed Actors.
It produces candy every few milliseconds by receiving a `MakeCandy` message, together with a metric and a trace that shows how long the production of candy takes.
If you are not familiar with Akka Actors, don't worry, as it is not the focus of this post.
All the source code shown in this post can be found at https://github.com/lunatech-labs/lunatech-traces-metrics-exemplars[lunatech-traces-metrics-exemplars repository]

[source,scala]
----
Behaviors.receive { (context, message) =>
  message match {
    case MakeCandy =>
      val span: Span = CandyMetrics.createSpan(tracer, "Making candy")
      val metric = CandyMetrics.ProductionCandyDurationHistogram.startTimer()

      makeCandy(context)

      span.end
      metric.observeDurationWithExemplar("TraceID", span.getSpanContext.getTraceId)
      Behaviors.same
  }
}
----

The metric and the trace are linked with the `observeDurationWithExemplar` method.

Besides the id of the trace the tag `TraceID` is necessary. This `TraceID` tag will appear later in our configuration.

For the metric we are using Prometheus metrics. We need to register the metrics beforehand:

[source,scala]
----
  final val ProductionCandyDurationHistogram: Histogram =
    Histogram
      .build()
      .namespace("lunatech")
      .subsystem("factory")
      .name("production_candy_duration")
      .help("Amount of time it takes to make one candy")
      .withExemplars()
      .register()
----
Prometheus supports exemplars for histograms and counter metrics.

For the tracing we are using OpenTelemetry. Here is the code to start a single span.

[source,scala]
----
tracer
  .spanBuilder(operationName)
  .setParent(Context.current())
  .startSpan()
----

In this example the trace will contain a single span, just for demonstration purposes.

=== Setup a docker-compose
In order to create the Exemplars visualization a few components are needed:

- Prometheus
- OpenTelemetry Collector
- Grafana
- Grafana Tempo

The complete setup can be found in https://github.com/lunatech-labs/lunatech-traces-metrics-exemplars/tree/master/docker[the docker folder]. I will only point out a few important details needed to bring Examplars together.

==== Prometheus
The following command has to be passed in the docker setup
[source,text]
----
--enable-feature=exemplar-storage
----

==== Grafana
Note the use of the `TraceID` tag in the setup of the https://github.com/lunatech-labs/lunatech-traces-metrics-exemplars/blob/master/docker/grafana/provisioning/datasources/datasource.yml[datasource] from Prometheus (also used in the source code):
[source,text]
----
 exemplarTraceIdDestinations:
   - name: TraceID
     datasourceUid: tempo
----


=== Link docker instances with the candy factory
Now that we have set up Prometheus in port 13798, we can start an HTTPServer that exports metrics.
[source,scala]
----
val prometheusPort = 13798
  new HTTPServer(prometheusPort)
  DefaultExports.initialize()
----

And finally, we need to also send the traces to the otel-collector:
[source,scala]
----
 val collectorEndpoint = "http://otel-collector:4317"
  val tracer: Tracer = Tracing.getTracer(collectorEndpoint)
----

We are still missing the code to instantiate the Tracer. For the sake of reducing the amount of code dumping that a look at the https://github.com/lunatech-labs/lunatech-traces-metrics-exemplars/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/lunatech/exemplars/observability/Tracing.scala[object Tracing here].

=== Grafana dashboard
In order to run docker-compose don't forget to first create the `lunatech-traces-metrics-exemplars` image with:
[source,text]
----
$ sbt docker
----
Now we are ready to launch docker-compose:
[source,text]
----
$ docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
----

In the browser Grafana will be available at `localhost:3000`. There's a dashboard already available. If you hover over the little diamonds you will see the exemplar's data details:

.Dashboard with details of one exemplar
image::dashboard_w_exemplar.png[Exemplar, width = 800]

Clicking on `Query with tempo` will take you to the corresponding trace in Tempo:

.Trace in Tempo
image::tempo_trace.png[Exemplar, width = 800]

=== Summary
In this post I have walked you through the steps needed to produce and visualize metrics and traces linked by Exemplars, in a docker-compose setup.
I hope this post has helped you to increase the observability of your systems.
