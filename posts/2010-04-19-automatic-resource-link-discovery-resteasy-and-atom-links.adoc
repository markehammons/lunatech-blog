:title: Automatic resource link discovery with RESTEasy and Atom links
:tags: [resteasy,java,rest]


This
article describes how to use http://www.jboss.org/resteasy/[RESTEasy]
to inject http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287[Atom] links in your
resource representations, in order to secure your
/editorials/tags/rest[RESTful] web services clients, and produce more
RESTful web services with link auto-discovery.

== Of resources and links

When doing RESTful web services, there's
always a big debate when it comes to linking resources together. The
non-RESTful way of doing things is to define
link:https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2009-02-03-what-every-web-developer-must-know-about-url-encoding[URL]s,
hand them over to the client and call it the API. But the real RESTful
way is to document your resources, a vocabulary of relations to link
them with one another, and insert links with their relations inside your
resources that indicate where sub-resources, related resources, and
operations are located. Example of link relations include “update this
resource” or “list of comments for this resource”.

This process is self-discovery, just like the good old web, which is
what REST is modeled on. Even then some people put
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-link-header-06[links in
the HTTP response headers] — which is better because it allows you to
parse the links without parsing the response, while others prefer to put
them directly on the resource representations — which allows more
fine-grained links, and the ability to have links on multiple resources.
Here is an example of such a link annotated with a relation:

[source,brush:,xml;,gutter:,false]
----
<atom:link href="http://localhost/books" rel="list"/>
----

=== Security on the client side

For a recent customer project, we needed to find a way to secure a
RESTful client interface, which turned out to be quite a shift from the
usual server-side-minded way of handling security. Let me explain. In
link:/editorials/tags/seam[Seam] or link:/editorials/tags/play[Play!],
the server executes a template (of sorts) which builds the HTML page
that the user is going to receive. On the server, we look at the current
user permissions and only give him links to actions he is allowed to
execute, to pages he is allowed to view:

[source,brush:,xml;,gutter:,false]
----
<h:commandLink action="#{Controller.deleteBook(book)}" 
  rendered="#{s:hasPermission(book, 'delete')}">Delete Book</h:commandLink>
----

But for this particular project we were building a very
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)[AJAX]y table viewer with
inline editing. So we had a JavaScript widget which handled data coming
in from REST web services. Our pages were not server-generated, but just
plain-old very efficient HTML pages, with very dynamic content. Since
every table entry could have different permissions, and the list of
entries were not known when the table's HTML page left the server (it
got in later via AJAX), it was impossible to use traditional server-side
templating to secure actions.

While the real security checks are done in the REST server side, since
the clients can always be bypassed, there has to be a level of security
filtering on the client to hide actions the user is not allowed to
perform (since they would fail should he try them, because of
server-side security).

=== Links as a security measure

The most RESTful way of doing such things is to let our table widget
discover the permissions for every row, and for the table itself. And
links are a great way to do this: simply specify a number of link
relations as part of the API (the documentation of your REST services,
which is mostly about resources) such as `add` or `remove`, and include
those links whenever the user has the permission to do the action. The
table widget then only has to see if entries have an `update` link to
know if the line is editable or not, and modify the UI accordingly.

There are two languages where links with relations are used: HTML and
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287[Atom]. For some reason,
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-4.2.7[Atom links] are the
ones most referred to when talking about REST, so that's the term we
will be using. Those are just a normalisation of how to write links and
relations.

=== Links in RESTEasy

http://www.jboss.org/resteasy/[RESTEasy] already had support for
http://www.jboss.org/file-access/default/members/resteasy/freezone/docs/1.2.GA/userguide/html/LinkHeader.html[Link
headers] (which contain Atom link equivalents) for a while, but for this
we needed resource-level links, and not response-level links, since our
responses contained more than one resource on multiple levels.

Did you know Lunatech Labs has a RESTEasy committer? Stéphane Épardaud
has been a long time RESTEasy user (since before the first release
really), and contributed to several modules such as
http://www.jboss.org/file-access/default/members/resteasy/freezone/docs/1.2.GA/userguide/html/Authentication.html#d0e2079[OAuth]
and the JavaScript Client API (in SVN for a while but not released yet).
With several experimental versions he finally got somewhere and produced
an API which is good enough to be added to RESTEasy, and is in fact
already used in production on our customer project.

Now when we get the following resource on our client, we know we are
allowed to `update` but not `remove` (because the relation is absent)
the given book:

[source,brush:,xml;,gutter:,false]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<book xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" title="foo" author="bar">
 <atom:link href="http://localhost/book/foo" rel="self"/>
 <atom:link href="http://localhost/book/foo" rel="update"/>
</book>
----

The following article is in fact the very documentation for this module,
that will appear in the 2.0 release of RESTEasy.

RESTEasy allows you to inject
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-4.2.7[Atom links] directly
inside the entity objects you are sending to the client, via
auto-discovery.

==== Warning

This is only available when using the Jettison or JAXB providers (for
JSON and XML).

The main advantage over Link headers is that you can have any number of
Atom links directly over the concerned resources, for any number of
resources in the response. For example, you can have Atom links for the
root response entity, and also for each of its children entities.

==== Configuration

There is no configuration required to be able to inject Atom
links in your resource representation, you just have to have this maven
artifact in your path:

.Table 8.1. Maven artifact for Atom link injection
[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Group |Artifact |Version
|org.jboss.resteasy |resteasy-links |2.0-beta-2
|===

==== Your first links injected

You need three things in order to tell RESTEasy to inject
Atom links in your entities:

* Annotate the JAX-RS method with `@AddLinks` to indicate
that you want Atom links injected in your response entity.
* Add `RESTServiceDiscovery` fields to the resource classes
where you want Atom links injected.
* Annotate the JAX-RS methods you want Atom links for with
`@LinkResource`, so that RESTEasy knows which links to create for which
resources.

The following example illustrates how you would declare
everything in order to get the Atom links injected in your book store:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
@Path("/")
@Consumes({"application/xml", "application/json"})
@Produces({"application/xml", "application/json"})
public interface BookStore {

  @AddLinks
  @LinkResource(value = Book.class)
  @GET
  @Path("books")
  public Collection<Book> getBooks();

  @LinkResource
  @POST
  @Path("books")
  public void addBook(Book book);

  @AddLinks
  @LinkResource
  @GET
  @Path("book/{id}")
  public Book getBook(@PathParam("id") String id);

  @LinkResource
  @PUT
  @Path("book/{id}")
  public void updateBook(@PathParam("id") String id, Book book);

  @LinkResource(value = Book.class)
  @DELETE
  @Path("book/{id}")
  public void deleteBook(@PathParam("id") String id);
}
----

And this is the definition of the Book resource:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
@Mapped(namespaceMap = 
 @XmlNsMap(jsonName = "atom", 
           namespace = "http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"))
@XmlRootElement
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.NONE)
public class Book {
  @XmlAttribute
  private String author;

  @XmlID
  @XmlAttribute
  private String title;

  @XmlElementRef
  private RESTServiceDiscovery rest;
}
----

If you do a GET /order/foo you will then get this XML
representation:

[source,brush:,xml;,gutter:,false]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<book xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" title="foo" author="bar">
 <atom:link href="http://localhost/books" rel="list"/>
 <atom:link href="http://localhost/books" rel="add"/>
 <atom:link href="http://localhost/book/foo" rel="self"/>

 <atom:link href="http://localhost/book/foo" rel="update"/>
 <atom:link href="http://localhost/book/foo" rel="remove"/>
</book>
----

And in JSON format:

[source,brush:,javascript;,gutter:,false]
----
{
 "book":
 {
  "@title":"foo",
  "@author":"bar",
  "atom.link":
   [
    {"@href":"http://localhost/books","@rel":"list"},
    {"@href":"http://localhost/books","@rel":"add"},
    {"@href":"http://localhost/book/foo","@rel":"self"},
    {"@href":"http://localhost/book/foo","@rel":"update"},
    {"@href":"http://localhost/book/foo","@rel":"remove"}
   ]
 }
}
----

==== Customising how the Atom links are serialised

Because the `RESTServiceDiscovery` is in fact a JAXB type
which inherits from `List` you are free to annotate it as you want to
customise the JAXB serialisation, or just rely on the default with
`@XmlElementRef`.

==== Specifying which JAX-RS methods are tied to which resources

This is all done by annotating the methods with the
`@LinkResource` annotation. It supports the following optional
parameters:

.Table 8.2  ¶ `@LinkResource` parameters
[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Type |Function |Default
|value |`Class` |Declares an Atom link for the given type of resources.
|Defaults to the entity body type (non-annotated parameter), or the
method's return type. This default does not work with `Response` or
`Collection` types, they need to be explicitly specified.

|rel |`String` |The Atom link relation a|
[.term]#list#::
  For `GET` methods returning a `Collection`
[.term]#self#::
  For `GET` methods returning a non-`Collection`
[.term]#remove#::
  For `DELETE` methods
[.term]#update#::
  For `PUT` methods
[.term]#add#::
  For `POST` methods

|===

You can add several `@LinkResource` annotations on a single
method by enclosing them in a `@LinkResources` annotation. This way you
can add links to the same method on several resource types. For example
the `/order/foo/comments` operation can belongs on the `Order` resource
with the `comments` relation, and on the `Comment` resource with the
`list` relation.

==== Specifying path parameter values for URI templates

When RESTEasy adds links to your resources it needs to
insert the right values in the URI remplate. This is done either
automatically by guessing the list of values from the entity, or by
specifying the values in the `@LinkResource` `pathParameters` parameter.

==== Loading URI template values from the entity

URI template values are extracted from the entity by
annotating a field or Java Bean property with the `@XmlID` annotation.
If there are more than one URI template value to find, we try to find
the parent of the entity in a field of Java Bean property annotated with
`@ParentResource`. The list of `@XmlID` values extracted up every
`@ParentResource` is then reversed and used as the list of values for
the URI template.

For example, let's consider the previous Book example, and
a list of comments:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
@XmlRootElement
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.NONE)
public class Comment {
  @ParentResource
  private Book book;

  @XmlElement
  private String author;

  @XmlID
  @XmlAttribute
  private String id;

  @XmlElementRef
  private RESTServiceDiscovery rest;
}
----

Given the previous book store service augmented with
comments:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
@Path("/")
@Consumes({"application/xml", "application/json"})
@Produces({"application/xml", "application/json"})
public interface BookStore {

  @AddLinks
  @LinkResources({
    @LinkResource(value = Book.class, rel = "comments"),
    @LinkResource(value = Comment.class)
  })
  @GET
  @Path("book/{id}/comments")
  public Collection<Comment> getComments(@PathParam("id") String bookId);

  @AddLinks
  @LinkResource
  @GET
  @Path("book/{id}/comment/{cid}")
  public Comment getComment(@PathParam("id") String bookId, 
                            @PathParam("cid") String commentId);

  @LinkResource
  @POST
  @Path("book/{id}/comments")
  public void addComment(@PathParam("id") String bookId, 
                         Comment comment);

  @LinkResource
  @PUT
  @Path("book/{id}/comment/{cid}")
  public void updateComment(@PathParam("id") String bookId, 
                            @PathParam("cid") String commentId, 
                            Comment comment);

  @LinkResource(Comment.class)
  @DELETE
  @Path("book/{id}/comment/{cid}")
  public void deleteComment(@PathParam("id") String bookId, 
                            @PathParam("cid") String commentId);

}
----

 Whenever we need to make links for a `Book` entity, we look
up the ID in the `Book`'s `@XmlID` property. Whenever we make links for
`Comment` entities, we have a list of values taken from the `Comment`'s
`@XmlID` and its `@ParentResource`: the `Book` and its `@XmlID`.

 For a `Comment` with `id` `"1"` on a `Book` with `title`
`"foo"` we will therefore get a list of URI template values of
`{"foo", "1"}`, to be replaced in the URI template, thus obtaining
either `"/book/foo/comments"` or `"/book/foo/comment/1"`.

==== Specifying path parameters manually

If you do not want to annotate your entities with `@XmlID`
and `@ParentResource`, you can also specify the URI template values
inside the `@LinkResource` annotation, using Unified Expression Language
expressions:

.Table 8.3.  ¶ `@LinkResource` URI template parameter
[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Type |Function |Default
|pathParameters |`String[]` |Declares a list of UEL expressions to
obtain the URI template values. |Defaults to using `@XmlID` and
`@ParentResource` annotations to extract the values from the model.
|===

The UEL expressions are evaluated in the context of the
entity, which means that any unqualified variable will be taken as a
property for the entity itself, with the special variable `this` bound
to the entity we're generating links for.

The previous example of `Comment` service could be declared
as such:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
@Path("/")
@Consumes({"application/xml", "application/json"})
@Produces({"application/xml", "application/json"})
public interface BookStore {

  @AddLinks
  @LinkResources({
    @LinkResource(value = Book.class, rel = "comments", 
                  pathParameters = "${title}"),
    @LinkResource(value = Comment.class, 
                  pathParameters = {"${book.title}", "${id}"})
  })
  @GET
  @Path("book/{id}/comments")
  public Collection<Comment> getComments(@PathParam("id") String bookId);

  @AddLinks
  @LinkResource(pathParameters = {"${book.title}", "${id}"})
  @GET
  @Path("book/{id}/comment/{cid}")
  public Comment getComment(@PathParam("id") String bookId, 
                            @PathParam("cid") String commentId);

  @LinkResource(pathParameters = {"${book.title}", "${id}"})
  @POST
  @Path("book/{id}/comments")
  public void addComment(@PathParam("id") String bookId, 
                         Comment comment);

  @LinkResource(pathParameters = {"${book.title}", "${id}"})
  @PUT
  @Path("book/{id}/comment/{cid}")
  public void updateComment(@PathParam("id") String bookId, 
                            @PathParam("cid") String commentId, 
                            Comment comment);

  @LinkResource(Comment.class, 
                pathParameters = {"${book.title}", "${id}"})
  @DELETE
  @Path("book/{id}/comment/{cid}")
  public void deleteComment(@PathParam("id") String bookId, 
                            @PathParam("cid") String commentId);

}
----

==== Securing entities

You can restrict which links are injected in the resource
based on security restrictions for the client, so that if the current
client doesn't have permission to delete a resource he will not be
presented with the `"delete"` link relation.

Security restrictions can either be specified on the
`@LinkResource` annotation, or using RESTEasy and EJB's security
annotation `@RolesAllowed` on the JAX-RS method.

.Table 8.4.  ¶ `@LinkResource` security restrictions
[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Type |Function |Default
|constraint |`String` |A UEL expression which must evaluate to true to
inject this method's link in the response entity. |Defaults to using
`@RolesAllowed` from the JAX-RS method.
|===

==== Extending the UEL context

We've seen that both the URI template values and the
security constraints of `@LinkResource` use UEL to evaluate expressions,
and we provide a basic UEL context with access only to the entity we're
injecting links in, and nothing more.

If you want to add more variables or functions in this
context, you can by adding a `@LinkELProvider` annotation on the JAX-RS
method, its class, or its package. This annotation's value should point
to a class that implements the `ELProvider` interface, which wraps the
default `ELContext` in order to add any missing functions.

For example, if you want to support the Seam annotation
`s:hasPermission(target, permission)` in your security constraints, you
can add a `package-info.java` file like this:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
@LinkELProvider(SeamELProvider.class)
package org.jboss.resteasy.links.test;

import org.jboss.resteasy.links.*;
----

With the following provider implementation:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
package org.jboss.resteasy.links.test;

import javax.el.ELContext;
import javax.el.ELResolver;
import javax.el.FunctionMapper;
import javax.el.VariableMapper;

import org.jboss.seam.el.SeamFunctionMapper;

import org.jboss.resteasy.links.ELProvider;

public class SeamELProvider implements ELProvider {

  public ELContext getContext(final ELContext ctx) {
    return new ELContext() {

      private SeamFunctionMapper functionMapper;

      @Override
      public ELResolver getELResolver() {
        return ctx.getELResolver();
      }

      @Override
      public FunctionMapper getFunctionMapper() {
        if (functionMapper == null)
          functionMapper = new SeamFunctionMapper(ctx
              .getFunctionMapper());
        return functionMapper;
      }

      @Override
      public VariableMapper getVariableMapper() {
        return ctx.getVariableMapper();
      }
    };
  }

}
----

And then use it as such:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
@Path("/")
@Consumes({"application/xml", "application/json"})
@Produces({"application/xml", "application/json"})
public interface BookStore {

  @AddLinks
  @LinkResources({
    @LinkResource(value = Book.class, rel = "comments", 
                  constraint = "${s:hasPermission(this, 'add-comment')}"),
    @LinkResource(value = Comment.class, 
                  constraint = "${s:hasPermission(this, 'insert')}")
  })
  @GET
  @Path("book/{id}/comments")
  public Collection<Comment> getComments(@PathParam("id") String bookId);

  @AddLinks
  @LinkResource(constraint = "${s:hasPermission(this, 'read')}")
  @GET
  @Path("book/{id}/comment/{cid}")
  public Comment getComment(@PathParam("id") String bookId, 
                            @PathParam("cid") String commentId);

  @LinkResource(constraint = "${s:hasPermission(this, 'insert')}")
  @POST
  @Path("book/{id}/comments")
  public void addComment(@PathParam("id") String bookId, 
                         Comment comment);

  @LinkResource(constraint = "${s:hasPermission(this, 'update')}")
  @PUT
  @Path("book/{id}/comment/{cid}")
  public void updateComment(@PathParam("id") String bookId, 
                            @PathParam("cid") String commentId, 
                            Comment comment);

  @LinkResource(Comment.class, 
                constraint = "${s:hasPermission(this, 'delete')}")
  @DELETE
  @Path("book/{id}/comment/{cid}")
  public void deleteComment(@PathParam("id") String bookId, 
                            @PathParam("cid") String commentId);

}
----

==== Resource facades

Sometimes it is useful to add resources which are just
containers or layers on other resources. For example if you want to
represent a collection of `Comment` with a start index and a certain
number of entries, in order to implement paging. Such a collection is
not really an entity in your model, but it should obtain the `"add"` and
`"list"` link relations for the `Comment` entity.

This is possible using resource facades. A resource facade
is a resource which implements the `ResourceFacade` interface for the
type `T`, and as such, should receive all links for that type.

Since in most cases the instance of the `T` type is not
directly available in the resource facade, we need another way to
extract its URI template values, and this is done by calling the
resource facade's `pathParameters()` method to obtain a map of URI
template values by name. This map will be used to fill in the URI
template values for any link generated for `T`, if there are enough
values in the map.

Here is an example of such a resource facade for a
collection of `Comment`s:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false]
----
@XmlRootElement
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.NONE)
public class ScrollableCollection implements ResourceFacade<Comment> {

  private String bookId;
  @XmlAttribute
  private int start;
  @XmlAttribute
  private int totalRecords;
  @XmlElement
  private List<Comment> comments = new ArrayList<Comment>();
  @XmlElementRef
  private RESTServiceDiscovery rest;

  public Class<Comment> facadeFor() {
    return Comment.class;
  }

  public Map<String, ? extends Object> pathParameters() {
    HashMap<String, String> map = new HashMap<String, String>();
    map.put("id", bookId);
    return map;
  }
}
----

This will produce such an XML collection:

[source,brush:,xml;,gutter:,false]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<collection xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" totalRecords="2" start="0">
 <atom.link href="http://localhost/book/foo/comments" rel="add"/>
 <atom.link href="http://localhost/book/foo/comments" rel="list"/>
 <comment xmlid="0">
  <text>great book</text>

  <atom.link href="http://localhost/book/foo/comment/0" rel="self"/>
  <atom.link href="http://localhost/book/foo/comment/0" rel="update"/>
  <atom.link href="http://localhost/book/foo/comment/0" rel="remove"/>
  <atom.link href="http://localhost/book/foo/comments" rel="add"/>
  <atom.link href="http://localhost/book/foo/comments" rel="list"/>
 </comment>

 <comment xmlid="1">
  <text>terrible book</text>
  <atom.link href="http://localhost/book/foo/comment/1" rel="self"/>
  <atom.link href="http://localhost/book/foo/comment/1" rel="update"/>
  <atom.link href="http://localhost/book/foo/comment/1" rel="remove"/>

  <atom.link href="http://localhost/book/foo/comments" rel="add"/>
  <atom.link href="http://localhost/book/foo/comments" rel="list"/>
 </comment>
</collection>
----

== Conclusion

RESTEasy is now able to generate Atom links for resources based on your
JAX-RS service declaration, with simple default settings and powerful
customisations for URI template variable resolving, security checks, and
UEL extension points. This is a feature that allowed us to easily and
RESTfully customise our client's user interfaces based on security
permissions that only the server knows.

Of course, this is only the beginning, because
http://www.lunatech-labs.com/open-source/jax-doclets[jax-doclets]
support is coming soon, as well as support in the JavaScript Client API,
which should allow you do do this soon:

[source,brush:,javascript;,gutter:,false]
----
// this line is already supported
var book = BookStore.getBook("foo");
book.title = "bar";
// This would then use the Atom link relations:
book.update();
// or
book.remove();
----
