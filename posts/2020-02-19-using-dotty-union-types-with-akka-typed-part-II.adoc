== Introduction

After posting the first article on https://blog.lunatech.com/2020-02-12-using-dotty-union-types-with-akka-typed[Using Dotty Union types with Akka Typed], I received https://twitter.com/hseeberger/status/1227660145125199877?s=20[valuable feedback] via Twitter which made me decide to write this follow-up article. I will clean up a few loose ends and add some new insights.

Let's take a bird's eye view of this follow-on content.

=== Loose End - The Protocol Problem!

Both the Scala 2 and the Dotty version of the `Pinger` actor suffer from the same problem: the actor's protocol has been unnecessarily _widened_. It should be _narrowed_ back to the absolute minimum shown in _figure 1_.

** In the Scala 2 version of the code, a message adapter is used that wraps the response from the `PingPong` actor. As part of the implementation, a `WrappedPongResponse` message _widens_ the actor protocol.
** In the Dotty version of the code, the protocol is _widened_ with the `PingPong.Response` type of messages (of which there is only one specific instance: the `PingPong.Pong` message).

=== Solutions and insights

As a fix for the protocol problem, we use a method in the Akka 2.6 library, `narrow`, and we'll look at how Dotty has the potential to simplify this approach.

=== Further Insights & Summary

I'll finish up with summarising a few of the best practices for coding actors that are to a large extent based on the https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/style-guide.html#style-guide[Akka Typed Style guide].

== Restoring the `Pinger` actor's protocol

Let's have a look at the final version of the protocol of the `Pinger` actor using Scala 2.13 and Akka 2.6:

[source,scala,linenums]
----
object Pinger {

  sealed trait Command
  case object SendPing extends Command
  case object StopPingPong extends Command
  final case class WrappedPongResponse(pong: PingPong.Response)
    extends Command

  ...
}
----

The problem should be obvious: we shouldn't expose the `WrappedPongResponse` wrapper message as part of the `Pinger` actor's protocol. In other words, we have unnecessarily _widened_ the actor's protocol by adding the publicly accessible `WrappedPongResponse` message to it.

Obviously, this is undesirable, and the fix in this case is quite simple: we can mark this message as private and we're done:

[source,scala,linenums]
----
object Pinger {

  sealed trait Command
  case object SendPing extends Command
  case object StopPingPong extends Command
  private final case class WrappedPongResponse(pong: PingPong.Response)
    extends Command

  ...
}
----

== Restoring the `Pinger` actor's protocol - Dotty version

The Dotty version of the `Pinger` actor suffers from the same problem. The protocol of the actor is _widened_ with the `PingPong.Pong` message. This means that _any_ actor can send a `Pong` message to the `Pinger` actor. The solution in this case is different from previous one:

* The `apply` method in the `Pinger` object, will return a `Behavior[Command]` thus restoring the original protocol
* The `Pinger` actor defines an internal behavior of type `Behavior[CommandsAndResponses]`
* The `Behavior[Command]` is derived from the `Behavior[CommandsAndResponses]` by applying the `narrow` method on the latter

This leads to the following code:

[source,scala,linenums]
----
object Pinger {

  // My protocol
  sealed trait Command
  case object SendPing extends Command
  case object StopPingPong extends Command

  // My protocol + the responses I need to understand...
  private type CommandsAndResponses = Command | PingPong.Response

  def apply(pingPong: ActorRef[PingPong.Ping]): Behavior[Command] = {
    val internalBehavior: Behavior[CommandsAndResponses] =
    Behaviors.setup { context =>
      Behaviors.receiveMessage {
        case StopPingPong =>
          context.log.info(s"End of the ping-pong game - calling it a day!")
          context.system.terminate()
          Behaviors.stopped
        case SendPing =>
          pingPong ! PingPong.Ping(replyTo = context.self)
          Behaviors.same
        case response : PingPong.Response =>
          context.log.info(s"Hey: I just received a $response !!!")
          Behaviors.same
      }
    }
    internalBehavior.narrow
  }
}
----

Admittedly, some magic has happened here and the question to ask is, _What is this `narrow` method doing_? Let's look at that in the next section.

== Clearing up some magic

The `Behavior` abstract class in Akka 2.6 defines the `narrow` method, and here is a part of the relevant source code:

[source,scala,linenums]
----
abstract class Behavior[T](private[akka] val _tag: Int) { behavior =>

  /**
   * Narrow the type of this Behavior, which is always a safe operation. This
   * method is necessary to implement the contravariant nature of Behavior
   * (which cannot be expressed directly due to type inference problems).
   */
  final def narrow[U <: T]: Behavior[U] = this.asInstanceOf[Behavior[U]]
  
  ...
}
  
abstract class ExtensibleBehavior[T] extends Behavior[T](BehaviorTags.ExtensibleBehavior) {

  ...
  
  def receive(ctx: TypedActorContext[T], msg: T): Behavior[T]
  
  ...
----

There's quite a bit going on here.

First, we note that the `Behavior` class is generic: it has a type parameter `T`, which, because of https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/variances.html[no specific variance annotation] on `T`, implies that `Behavior` is _invariant_ in its type parameter `T`. Also note the comment on the `narrow` method, stating: 

> _This method is necessary to implement the contravariant nature of Behavior (which cannot be expressed directly due to type inference problems)_.

Second, we see that the class `ExtensibleBehavior`, which is a subclass of `Behavior`, has a `receive` method which takes a parameter `msg` of type `T`. Because functions (or _methods_), are contravariant in their argument types, the only possible variance case for the type parameter is invariant (`T`) or contravariant (`-T`). Because of type inference problems in Scala 2, the former was chosen.

NOTE: Variance manifests itself in specific contexts and is a big topic in itself with _contravariance_ being the least intuitive. We'll see however that, in the case of `Behavior`, it is actually quite easy to understand. I'll get back to that later. For a comprehensive explanation of variance in Scala read https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/variances.html[this article].

Finally, we see from the definition of the `narrow` method, that it returns a behavior which is more restrictive in its type than the behavior on which it is called. The implementation of `narrow` uses `asInstanceOf` to apply this restriction. 

== Clearing up some magic in the context of Dotty

All the above is nice, but it will leave some readers with questions. So, let's look at this from a practical point of view by looking at the Dotty version of the `Pinger` which uses Union types.

Starting from the (internal) protocol definition:

[source,scala,linenums]
----
object Pinger {
  sealed trait Command
  case object SendPing extends Command
  case object StopPingPong extends Command

  // My protocol + the responses I need to understand...
  type CommandsAndResponses = Command | PingPong.Response
}

object PingPong {
  sealed trait Command
  final case class Ping(replyTo: ActorRef[Response]) extends Command

  sealed trait Response
  case object Pong extends Response
}
----

We can run the following experiment (in _dotr_, the Dotty REPL):

[source,scala,linenums]
----
scala> import akka.actor.typed.ActorRef

scala> object Pinger {
     |   sealed trait Command
     |   case object SendPing extends Command
     |   case object StopPingPong extends Command
     |
     |   // My protocol + the responses I need to understand...
     |   type CommandsAndResponses = Command | PingPong.Response
     | }
     |
     | object PingPong {
     |   sealed trait Command
     |   final case class Ping(replyTo: ActorRef[Response]) extends Command
     |
     |   sealed trait Response
     |   case object Pong extends Response
     | }
// defined object Pinger
// defined object PingPong

scala> summon[Pinger.Command <:< Pinger.CommandsAndResponses]
val res0: Pinger.Command =:= Pinger.Command = generalized constraint
----

The fact that the last command returned a _generalized constraint_ means that `Pinger.Command` is a subtype of `Pinger.CommandsAndResponses` or, differently expressed: an instance of `Pinger.Command` can be considered as being an instance of `Pinger.CommandAndResponses`.

Imagine now that `Behavior` is defined as contravariant in its type parameter `T` (and define it as a _trait_ instead of an _abstract class_ in the Akka source code so that for this demo, we can easily create an instance of it).

[source,scala,linenums]
----
scala> trait Behavior[-A] {}

scala> summon[Behavior[Pinger.CommandsAndResponses] <:< Behavior[Pinger.Command]]
val res1: Behavior[Pinger.CommandsAndResponses] =:=
  Behavior[Pinger.CommandsAndResponses] = generalized constraint
----

The last line in the _dotr_ session tells us that an instance of `Behavior[Pinger.CommandsAndResponses]` can be considered to be an instance of `Behavior[Pinger.Command]`. This allows us to do the following:

[source,scala,linenums]
----
// We can mark the following variable as private, but this doesn't work in the REPL
scala> val internalBehavior = new Behavior[Pinger.CommandsAndResponses] {} 
val internalBehavior: Behavior[Pinger.CommandsAndResponses] = anon$1@8f221a7

scala> val externalBehavior: Behavior[Pinger.Command] = internalBehavior
val externalBehavior: Behavior[Pinger.Command] = anon$1@8f221a7
----

Let this sink in for a second... We have achieved something important: we derived our `externalBehavior` from the more specific `internalBehavior` by using the type system and appropriate variance definitions and this without having to apply the `narrow` method!

Does this make sense intuitively? It does: `externalBehavior` is declared as a behavior that is able to 'process' all messages that are part of the `Pinger` actor's `Command` protocol. The behavior that is actually handling these messages is the `internalBehavior` which, on top of the messages of type `Command`, is able to process the `PingPong.Pong` message.

NOTE: One could say that from the outside, the internal behavior is not utilised to its full extent.

The combination of Dotty Union types combined with the generic `Behavior` of having a contravariant type parameter leads to a very simple implementation of the `Pinger` actor. The future will tell if, with Dotty, Akka will be able to exploit this in a future version.

== Returning to best practices for coding up actors in Akka Typed

The coding style I'm using is drawn from the https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/style-guide.html#style-guide[Akka Typed Style guide]. This guide leaves some choices to the programmer such as choosing between an _object oriented style_ or a _functional style_. For the functional style, I prefer to put the core behavior of a typed actor in a companion class. An advantage of this approach is that the method that will return the initial behavior doesn't have to take extra contextual parameters that need to be passed in: these can be added as class parameters. In simple cases, that may be considered overkill, but as a counter argument, I think that applying the same practice in a consistent manner helps to maintain a recurring and easily recognisable way of coding actors.

The Dotty version of the `Pinger` actor will then look as follows:

[source,scala,linenums]
----
import akka.actor.typed.{ActorRef, Behavior}
import akka.actor.typed.scaladsl.{ActorContext, Behaviors}

object Pinger {

  // My protocol
  sealed trait Command
  case object SendPing extends Command
  case object StopPingPong extends Command

  // My protocol + the responses I need to understand...
  private type CommandsAndResponses = Command | PingPong.Response

  def apply(pingPong: ActorRef[PingPong.Ping]): Behavior[Command] = {
    val internalBehavior = Behaviors.setup[CommandsAndResponses] { context =>
      (new Pinger(context, pingPong)).run()
    }
    internalBehavior.narrow
  }
}

class Pinger private (context: ActorContext[Pinger.CommandsAndResponses], pingPong: ActorRef[PingPong.Ping]) {

  import Pinger._

  def run(): Behavior[CommandsAndResponses] =
    Behaviors.receiveMessage {
      case StopPingPong =>
        context.log.info(s"End of the ping-pong game - calling it a day!")
        context.system.terminate()
        Behaviors.stopped
      case SendPing =>
        pingPong ! PingPong.Ping(replyTo = context.self)
        Behaviors.same
      case response : PingPong.Response =>
        context.log.info(s"Hey: I just received a $response !!!")
        Behaviors.same
    }
}
----

Note that we prevent the direct creation of instances of the `Pinger` actor by marking the constructor of the `Pinger` class private.

=== Conclusions

In this article:

* I have shown in both Scala 2 and Dotty how to handle responses sent to other actors without unnecessarily widening the message protocol:
** In Scala 2, we can use message adapters where the message wrapper is marked private.
** In Dotty, we can use the `narrow` method on `Behavior`.
* we looked at a potential alternative to `Behavior.narrow` which may become reality sometime in the future.
* we concluded with a look at best practices to code an Actor using Akka Typed.
